## In order to use this, or any command line tools with AWS, you need to complete the aws cli setup.

### Install aws cli for your OS - dependencies are python2.7ï¿½and pip, for me anyways
boto will automatically be installed as well, boto is used to pass your credentials to aws, once aws cli is installed correctly you should be able to run:

### There are some default scripts that AWS uses to communicate with ansible, included in this repo are ec2.py and ec2.ini
Store these files at /etc/ansible on your machine, 
```
./install_ec2scripts.sh
```
then set environment variables:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your key'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your secret key'
export ANSIBLE_HOSTS=/etc/ansible/ec2.py
export EC2_INI_PATH=/etc/ansible/ec2.ini
```

You can use a virtualenv to set these variables, or set them globally, I have had better success with virtualenv:

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv aws_env
source aws_env/bin/activate
```

You will see the environment at the beginning of your cli prompt (aws_env), to deactivate the virtualenv

```
deactivate
```

With that activated - the following command should produce results about instances.  If any variables are missing add them to the environment

```
/etc/ansible/ec2.py --list
```

Now you are ready to interact with AWS, run the create script:

```
./create.sh
```

It will take a few minutes to complete, an instance is being created
*The next one is faster, enter 'yes' if asked "Do you want to allow the connection?" (it is a new server):

```
./configure.sh
```
Upgrade script added - upgrade this instance to AS 2.1.12

```
ansible-playbook tasks/update.yml
```
When that script has finished, terminate the instance at any time with:

```
./terminate.sh
```

We can add more testing commands to the configure.sh script as needed.
You can obviously also ssh into the instance once it is created, if needed.  Keypair is openvpn...
